# RottenMangoes

Simple Objective-C application that fetches movies currently in theatres from rotten tomatoes and displays their posters in a collection view. Tapping on a movie shows details about it and reviews (tapping on reviews shows the original review website in a WebKit view). Tapping nearby theatres shows theatres nearby that are playing the selected movie.
